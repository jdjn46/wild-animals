	<p>The Southern African lion (Panthera leo melanochaita) is a lion subspecies in Southern Africa.In this part of Africa, lion populations occur in Angola, Botswana, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zambia and Zimbabwe, but are regionally extinct in Lesotho. Lion populations in intensively managed protected areas in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have increased since the turn of the century.</p>

	<p>The type specimen for P. l. melanochaita was a black-maned lion from the Cape of Good Hope, known as the Cape lion. The lion population in this part of South Africa is extinct. Living lion populations in other parts of Southern Africa were referred to by several regional names, including Katanga lion, Transvaal lion, Kalahari lion, Southwest African lion, and South African lion.</p>

	<p>In the 1980s, the Southern African lion has been described as the largest living African lion subspecies.</p>
